                <h4>Background</h4>

                <p>My name is Bruce Wayne, a few people know me as Batman. I was born and raised in a place called
                    Gotham
                    City, sometimes known as New York. When I was a child, I saw my parents get robbed and killed
                    infront of
                    me, that was extremly traumatizing.
                    Since I hade no other relatives, I hade 2 choices. One of them was going to an orphanage, or being
                    taken
                    care of by the family butler Alfred. The choice was simple, I chose Alfred. I also made a promise to
                    avenge my parents death, and
                    protect my city, Gotham City. Growing up I had to leave Gotham to travel the world, mature and learn
                    how
                    to fight just so I could return and defend my city.</p>

                        <h4>Merits & Training</h4>

                        <p> When I got older, I started combat training, learning criminology and gun training. This
                            helped
                            me defeat criminals, I also disappeared to an island called Okinawa to train Kung-fu, which
                            also
                            is very good to learn while defeating
                            criminals. I lived alone but got to know an old man who helped me whith the language &
                            criminoligy. This man used to work for the Japanese police and trained Kung-fu, which he
                            taught
                            me.

                        <p>
                            I want people to know that my goal with protecting my city is to try to lower the criminal
                            activities as Batman. It is indeed almost impossible, but i will do my very best, I have
                            already
                            lowered the criminal rate by 50%. Today, I help the police in Gotham
                            keeping the city safe, other then that, I run my successfull company and have charity events
                            to
                            help the people in need. The company that my parents left me was being taken care of by
                            Alfred,
                            he ran everything very good. When I
                            decided to come back home, I took over. Ever since that day, I have turned the million
                            dollar
                            company to a billion dollar company.
